# prework-study-guide Webpage

## Description

-   Beginning a new course can be daunting. Beginning a new course while already at Uni feels almost suicidal, however, in my pursuit to give myself as much of a chance of survival by means of employment or better yet self-employment I decided to learn web development.
-   Apart from being part of the course requirement building this project allowed me to develop my skills in real time.
-   I found that being able to navigate environments like the terminal and github was essential to web development.
-   What did you learn? I learned a lot about JavaScript; variables, functions, arrays, and loops. Also, I learned a lot more about gitub; setting up a repo, using push and pull requests, and deploying a small static site on github.
